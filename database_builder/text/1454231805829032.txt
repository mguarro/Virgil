      With the purpose of enhancement in the contrast ratio of a cholesteric-blue-phase liquid crystal display by reducing driving vltoage and light 
      leakage, we made a prototype of a 3.4-inch polymer-stabilized blue-phase (PS-BP) liquid crystal display including highly reliable crystalline 
      oxide semiconductor. As a result, the contrast ratio over 1000:1 was achieved in a dark place.

      The PS-BP liquid crystal
       is generally driven by a 
      lateral electric field as in an in-plane-switching (IPS) mode. For its 
      electrode structure, various types of structures which enable high 
      electric-field intensity and low driving voltage have been proposed 
      7), 21-25)
       because driving voltage of blue-phase liquid crystal is high 
      and a high white luminance is not easily obtained, and thus to 
      obtain high contrast ratio is difficult. In addition, light leakage 
      occurs due to Bragg diffraction in the blue-phase liquid crystal. It is 
      necessary to solve these problems in order to improve the contrast 
      ratio. 
      Thus, a blue-phase material was optimized to lower the 
      driving voltage and to make diffraction wavelength have a peak in 
      the ultraviolet region, and light leakage from a pixel electrode was 
      suppressed. As a result, the contrast ratio over 1000:1 of a liquid 
      crystal display was achieved without using a black matrix (BM) 
      for the first time in the world.

      2. Optimization of Blue-Phase Material 
      Selection of Chiral Material 
      For low-voltage driving of PS-BP liquid crystal, it is 
      important to employ a chiral material with high helical twisting 
      power (HTP) and reduce the amount of added chiral material. The 
      HTPs of Chiral Material A and Chiral Material B were measured 
      using a wedge-shaped cell. Table I shows the measurement results. 
      From Table I, Chiral Material B has higher HTP than 
      Chiral Material A, so Chiral Material B is suitable for a blue-phase

      light leakage was markedly observed in the vicinity of a source 
      wiring and a gate wiring, and at a pixel electrode having a rib 
      which is made for decreasing the driving voltage of a blue phase 
      liquid crystal. 
      Further, the state of light leakage changed as the 
      polarizers rotated, i.e., anisotropy was confirmed. Light leakage, 
      particularly light leakage due to the electrode having a rib is 
      probably caused by not only a difference between refractive 
      indices but also another factor, and this factor might be derived 
      from form birefringence. 
      Thus, the factors of anisotropic light leakage were 
      divided into a factor due to a pixel electrode and a factor due to a 
      source wiring and a gate wiring, and the panel layout and the pixel 
      electrode structure were reconsidered, so that a reduction in light 
      leakage was verified(Fig. 4-(2)).

      Characteristics of PS-BP Liquid Crystal 
      Chiral Material B, a monomer, and polymerization 
      initiator were added into liquid crystal, the mixture was injected 
      into cells
      to which lateral electric field is applied, and 
      polymer-stabilization treatment was performed, so that PS-BP 
      liquid crystal was obtained. 
      Figure 3 shows the results of V-T characteristics of the 
      obtained PS-BP liquid crystal. The cell used here was an IPS cell 
      with a protrusion electrode having a rib. The rib is made of a 
      photosensitive resin and covered with a transparent electrode. The 
      width of the rib was 2 m and the interval of ribs was 3 m. The 
      μ
      μ
      width of the transparent electrode was 3 m and the interval of 
      μ
      transparent electrodes was 2 m. PS-BP with this structure 
      μ
      containing Chiral Material B enabled low voltage driving. The 
      voltage V
       at which the normalized transmittance is 100 was 
      %

       at which the normalized 
      as low as 31 V, and the voltageV 
      90
      transmittance is 90 was as low as 22 V. 
      %
      In addition, the peak of the diffraction wavelength of 
      the PS-BP is 367 nm when no voltage is applied, which means that 
      the amount of light leakage due to Bragg diffraction is small.

      Panel Layout 
      In a general liquid crystal display, light leakage is 
      reduced by blocking light with BM. In the case of PS-BP, uniform 
      light irradiation on the entire surface of a panel is needed for 
      polymer stabilization treatment, which makes it difficult to provide 
      BM on a counter substrate. 
      As a countermeasure to this problem, wirings such as a 
      source wiring and a gate wiring are arranged to be parallel or 
      vertical to the absorption axis direction of polarizers, and only pixel 
      electrodes are arranged at an angle of 45 to the absorption axis 
      °
      direction of polarizers. Thus, light leakage caused by the source 
      wiring and the drain wiring can be reduced without using BM .
    
    
      3. Panel Structure 
      A lateral electric field driving mode such as an IPS 
      mode is used for driving a blue-phase liquid crystal. The angle 
      formed by the absorption axis direction of the polarizers and the 
      pixel electrode direction needs to be 45. However, with this 
      °
      arrangement structure, light leakage occurred (Fig. 4-(1)). Such 
    
    
      Pixel Electrode Structure 
      Form birefringence is caused by phase difference 
      generated between a direction where the periodic structure exists

      and a direction perpendicular to the direction. The electrode 
      structure with a linear rib has a periodic structure formed by liquid 
      crystal, a transparent electrode, and a rib. In such a structure, the 
      phase difference is probably generated to break the polarization 
      state and thus light leakage occurs. 
      In order to reduce light leakage due to form 
      birefringence, we focused on the thickness of the transparent 
      electrode and made the experimental cells of PS-BP in which the 
      thicknesses of the transparent electrodes with a linear rib are 20 nm, 
      40 nm, 60 nm, 80 nm, and 100 nm. 
      Figure 5 shows the relation between the black 
      luminance when no voltage is applied and the thickness of the 
      transparent electrode. In Fig. 5, ref. represents a state where 
      polarizers are arranged in crossed Nicols without an experimental 
      cell. The black luminance was measured using polarizers arranged 
      in crossed Nicols with incidence of diffusion light. The absorption 
      °
      axis direction of polarizers was arranged at an angle of 45 to the 
      pixel electrode direction.

      The experimental cells of PS-BP were manufactured 
      with the use of a substrate with this electrode structure. 
      Figure 7 shows relation between the black luminance 
      when no voltage is applied and the electrode structure (the rib 
      shape-thickness of the electrode). Two types of rib shapes, a 
      square-pyramid rib and a linear rib were used. In Fig. 7, ref. 
      represents a state where polarizers are arranged in crossed Nicols 
      without an experimental cell. The black luminance was measured 
      using polarizers arranged in crossed Nicols with incidence of 
      diffusion light. The absorption axis direction of polarizers was 
      arranged at an angle of 45 to the pixel electrode direction.

      The data of the black luminance indicates that light 
      leakage increases as the electrode becomes thicker. 
      The black luminance of the electrode having a rib is 
      higher than that of the polarizers arranged in crossed Nicols 
      without an experimental cell, so that light leakage cannot be 
      satisfactorily suppressed by only a reduction in thickness of the 
      electrode. Therefore, as an additional countermeasure against light 
      leakage, a rib electrode in which square pyramids are arranged as 
      illustrated in Fig. 6 was made. 
    
    
      The data of the black luminance indicates that light 
      leakage is reduced due to the square-pyramid rib. 
      The probable reason of this is that the rib region which 
      is at an angle of 45 to the absorption axis direction of polarizer is 
      °
      reduced by employing a rib electrode in which square pyramids 
      are arranged and thus light leakage caused by form birefringence is 
      also reduced. 
    
    
      4. Display Characteristics 
      We made a prototype of a 3.4-inch blue-phase liquid 
      crystal display (Table II). The FETs used here include crystalline 
      IGZO with a CAAC structure. Figure 8 shows TEM images of an 
    
  
  
    
      IGZO thin film we fabricated. In this film, c-axes are aligned in a 
      direction perpendicular to a substrate, and the a-b planes of IGZO 
      crystals are formed in mosaic arrangements. The crystal grain 
      boundaries are unclear. The pixels and driver circuits are formed in 
      an integrated manner with FETs including crystalline IGZO. 
    
    
      5. Conclusion 
      With the use of the optimized blue-phase material and 
      electrode structure, a prototype of a 3.4-inch blue-phase liquid 
      crystal display including a highly reliable crystalline oxide 
      semiconductor was manufactured, so that the contrast ratio 1100:1 
      was achieved in a dark place.
