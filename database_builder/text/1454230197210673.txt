      Abstract-In this paper we evaluate a MAC-layer contention-
      based forwarding scheme for vehicular networks that prioritizes
      access according to node position. In particular, we consider
      two schemes that use a geometrically-increasing probability
      distribution for choosing the contention slots but, in the first
      case, the distribution is appropriately weighted, and in the
      second case, vehicles select the window size according to their
      position. We analytically evaluate the total and per-vehicle success
      probabilities and the average delay bounds. Our results show that
      a weighted geometric distribution effectively prioritizes the access
      based on position for a wide range of vehicle densities, while
      retaining the benefits of geometrical distributions with respect to
      success probabilities and delay bounds.

      implicit reliability mechanism in case the most suitable router
      does not receive the packet, which in such a highly dynamic
      environment is quite likely. Contention-based forwarding may
      be implemented at network layer or directly at the MAC layer.
      Implementing CBF at MAC layer should result in lower de-
      lays than network layer operation, since forwarding and access
      delays are integrated. Moreover, CSMA/CA mechanisms can
      be controlled with several parameters, like contention window
      size and intervals as well as the probability distribution for the
      slot selection, which results in multiple degrees of freedom
      to optimize MAC operation according to the most critical
      functionality offered by the network. For instance, such an
      optimization should benefit safety and emergency related
      applications which rely and are built on top of the functionality
      of the geo-routing protocol. As drawback, implementation at
      the MAC layer may be potentially more complex, requiring at
      least firmware modification.
      CBF operation synchronizes medium access of all nodes,
      that is, all receivers of a packet immediately become potential
      forwarders and contend for the medium. In this particular
      situation, in [5] it is shown that there exists an optimal
      distribution for the contention slots that maximizes the con-
      tention success probability. Although the optimal distribution
      cannot be implemented in practice, geometric distributions
      approximate the optimal one. With such a distribution the
      conditional access probability in case of success is uniformly
      distributed among all the contenders. However, the main goal
      of CBF is to prioritize the access of the most suitable node
      according to its position. Therefore, our objective is to find
      a mechanism that prioritizes access based on position while
      retaining the good properties of geometric distributions.
      The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
      Section II we briefly review the related work. A MAC-layer
      CBF scheme that prioritizes access according to node position
      is proposed in Section III. In Section IV we analytically
      evaluate the total and per-vehicle success probabilities and the
      average delay bounds. Finally, conclusions and future work
      are remarked in Section V.
    
    
      II. RELATED ORKW
      Because of the dynamic nature of the mobile nodes in the
      network, finding and maintaining routes is very challenging in
      VANETs. Routing in VANETs (with pure ad hoc architectures)
      has been studied recently and many different protocols have
    
    
      I. INTRODUCTION
      Inter-vehicle communications based on wireless technolo-
      gies pave the way for innovative applications in traffic safety,
      driver-assistance, traffic control and other advanced services
      which will make up future Intelligent Transportation Systems
      (ITS) [1]. Communications for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks
      (VANET) have been developed and standardized in the last
      years. At the moment, a dedicated short range communication
      (DSRC) bandwidth has been allocated to vehicular communi-
      cations at 5.9 GHz and both American and European standards
      [2] have adopted IEEE 802.11p as physical and medium access
      control (MAC) layers, based on carrier-sense multiple access
      with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
      At the network layer, European standards [3] specify the
      GeoNetworking protocol as the default network layer protocol
      for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. It provides pac-
      ket routing based on the use of geographical positions, that is,
      a geo-routing protocol. GeoNetworking (GeoNet) supports the
      communication among individual ITS stations as well as the
      distribution of packets in geographical areas. If the source node
      does not belong to the destination geo-area, then the packet
      should be forwarded until reaching a node which belongs
      to this area, which takes care on delivering the packet to
      its destination. As basic forwarding algorithms, [3] defines
      greedy forwarding and contention-based forwarding (CBF)
      [4]. The latter makes a receiver decide if it becomes the next
      forwarder, according to its position. Upon receiving a packet,
      all routers start a timer whose timeout depends on the specific
      position of the router, usually inversely proportional to the
      distance. The major advantage of CBF is that it provides an
    
  
  
    
      the same probability of success in accessing the channel. On
      the contrary, for many applications in VANETs it is needed
      that certain vehicles have a success probability greater than the
      rest of them. A clear example is the usual GeoNet scenario
      described in Section I, where the node located farthest away
      should have priority access. In summary, our purpose is to
      design a protocol that assigns higher success probability to
      the nearest node to the destination, but without decreasing the
      total success probability. This is achieved by allowing that
      each vehicle uses a different probability distribution for the
      slot selection, based on its own position. Next we propose
      variations of Sift that retain its benefits but adapting the
      operation to the needs of the GeoNet protocol.
    
    
      been proposed. The authors in [6] classify them into five
      categories as follows: ad hoc, position-based, cluster-based,
      broadcast and geocast routing.
      The objective of a geocast routing [7] is to deliver the
      packet from a source node to all other nodes within a specified
      geographical region. Most geocast routing methods are based
      on directed flooding, which tries to limit the message overhead
      and network congestion of simple flooding by defining a
      forwarding zone and restricting the flooding inside it. Non-
      flooding approaches are also proposed [8], [9], aiming to limit
      the number of concurrent packets within the network.
      We are particularly interested in the methods that use
      the contention scheme at the MAC layer to select the next
      forwarding node. This is achieved either by adapting the time
      when to forward the packet or by introducing rules on whether
      a given vehicle should forward the packet at all as in [4]. If
      CSMA/CA is used at the MAC layer, not only the contention
      window size may be selected [10] but also the distribution
      function used for the selection of the contention slots may
      be specifically adapted [5]. In this paper, we use the latter
      approach, adapting the method in [5] not only to reduce the
      message overhead, but to prioritize the retransmission of the
      packet by certain nodes (e.g. the farthest node).
    
    
      A. Weighted Sift
      The first method we propose is to weight the Sift distribution
      according to the respective position of vehicles within the
      transmission range of the source node, giving a higher success
      probability to the farthest nodes.

      DAPTATIONS OF IFT FOR RIORITIZED CCESS

      III. A
      Sift is the contention technique proposed in [5] for event-
      driven networks where a set of nodes tries to send a packet
      simultaneously
      . That is, when there are synchronized channel
      access attempts among many nodes. The key idea in Sift
      is to use a non-uniform, geometrically-increasing probability
      distribution for choosing the slots (
      ) within a fixed-
      1, . . . , CW
      CW
      size contention window ( ), rather than varying the window
      size as in many traditional MAC protocols. The resulting
      protocol performs well when the number of nodes trying to
      CW
      send data is large in relation to
      , therefore it scales well
      when the number of contenders grows.
      The Sift protocol assigns the probability that a node chooses
      r
      the slot
      as :

      the shape of the probability distribution.
      Let us note that using CBF for GeoNet implies that all
      the packets are broadcast. In this mode, there is no reliability
      mechanisms, such as acknowledgment packets, and every
      transmission is independent of each other. In addition, all
      receiving nodes become simultaneously potential forwarders
      simultaneously
      (contenders)
      . When a node wins the conten-
      tion, it rebroadcasts the packet and the process is exactly the
      same, and actually keeps on this way until the packet reaches
      the destination area.
      Therefore, we might expect that Sift as contention dis-
      tribution optimize the operation of GeoNet hop by hop.
      However, with the Sift distribution, all the vehicles use the
      same distribution for the slot selection, so all of them have
    
  
  
    
      The probability of a successful transmission for an arbitrary
      V
      (in any slot) is calculated as the sum of the proba-
      vehicle

      Immediately from eq. (8) we can compute the probability
      of a successful transmission for the last group of vehicles and
      the total probability of a successful transmission as follows:
    
    
      B. Per groups Sift
      The second method we consider is to divide the total number
      of vehicles into different groups, depending on their priorities.
      In particular, as we assume the priority is given by the position,
      C
      we divide the transmission range into intervals. The group
      of vehicles placed in each of these intervals selects their
      contention slots by using the Sift probability distribution with
      different values for the contention window (lower values for
      higher priorities).

      OMPARATIVE VALUATION
      IV. C
      E
      In this section we present a comparative study to show
      the performance of the proposed methods as forwarding al-
      gorithms.
      We consider a one-dimensional scenario in which vehicles
      are uniformly distributed. The transmission range is assumed
      to be constant and equal to
      meters for all the vehicles, and
      300
      each vehicle knows its own position in the road segment. We
      assume that after a first transmission of the packet from the
      source node, all the vehicles in the transmission range have
      received correctly the packet and all of them contend to be
      the next forwarder.
      We are concerned here exclusively with the probability of
      success of the proposed distributions, rather than the actual re-
      ception probability, which also depends on fading and channel
      error. We only need to know the total number of contenders
      and their positions for the analytic computations. In fact, a real
      implementation of the proposed protocols only would require
      to approximately know the transmission range and that each
      vehicle would know its own position.
    
    
      A. Performance metrics
      N
      Assuming that there are vehicles contending to be the
      next forwarder, and that the size of the contention window is

      , for each protocol we construct a matrix of dimension
      P

      (Fig. 3(b)) the success probability drops to zero
      50
      for all the contending vehicles. For the two proposed protocols
      we can see better in Fig. 3(b) how the probability grows when
      approaching the last vehicle/group of vehicles.
      In Fig. 4 the probability of a successful transmission in each
      slot is represented when the number of contenders is fixed to
      (Fig. 4(a)) and (Fig. 4(b)). For the first case, we can
      20
      50
      observe that the probability for the CBF is concentrated on the
      first slot, but when the number of vehicles is
      (Fig. 4(b))
      50
      the success probability is zero for all the slots. Looking at
      Per groups Sift
      Fig. 4(b) we can observe that the
      gives a high
      success probability to the first few slots. On the other hand,
      Weighted Sift
      the original Sift outperforms the
      in terms of the
      slot success probability, since the latter gives more success
      probability to later slots, which increases the forwarding delay.
      It seems that Sift would perform slightly better in terms of
      delay. However, if we actually consider the average delay to
      the destination, that is, the multihop or end-to-end delay the
      results are different as discussed next.
      We consider a multi-hop scenario, where the destination

      B. Results
      The total probability of a successful transmission and the
      probability of a successful transmission for the last group
      of vehicles are shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, for
      the two proposed protocols, as well as for the original Sift
      protocol and for a basic Contention Based Forwarding (CBF)
      algorithm. The number of vehicles is varied between and
      10
      , while the contention window is always fixed to slots.

      It can be seen in Fig. 1 that when the number of vehicles
      is small (up to ) the success probability for the CBF is 1,
      30
      clearly outperforming the other protocols. However, when the
      number of vehicles increases, the success probability becomes
      0, because more than one vehicle is always close enough to
      select the same slot. On the contrary, the other proposals scale
      much better, maintaining almost the same success probability.
      The same holds for the probability of a successful transmission
      for the last group of vehicles (Fig. 2).
      Let us recall that our main goal is to give higher priority to
      the farthest vehicle. Our proposals achieve this goal and out-
      performs other possibilities. Looking at Fig. 1 again, the total
      Weighted Sift
      success probability for the
      is slightly superior
      Per groups Sift
      than Sift, whereas for the
      it is significantly
      lower than the others. Nevertheless, when we observe the
      success probability of the last group of vehicles (Fig. 2), both
      Weighted Sift
      Per groups Sift
      the
      and the
      clearly outperform
      the original Sift protocol.
      In Fig. 3 the probability of a successful transmission for
      each vehicle is shown when the number of contenders is fixed
      to (Fig. 3(a)) and (Fig. 3(b)).

      delay, since the computed lower and upper bounds are weak,
      a realistic simulation is needed to show the true benefits of
      the proposed protocols, which is left as future work. On the
      other hand, we have arbitrarily fixed several parameters of the
      distribution, e.g., the window size. We leave as future work
      as well a more detailed study on how to choose the more
      appropriate parameters and their influence.

      In this paper we study CBF mechanisms for GeoNetworking
      implemented at MAC layer. We considered two schemes that
      use geometrically-distributed contention slots. We have analy-
      tically evaluated the total and per-vehicle success probabilities
      and the average delay bounds and compared them with a
      basic CBF mechanism and the original Sift protocol. Our
      results show that a weighted geometric distribution effectively
      prioritizes the access based on position for a wide range of
      vehicle densities, while retaining the benefits of geometrical
      distributions with respect to success probabilities and delay
      bounds. In particular, while a CBF mechanism with static
      timers needs to adapt the contention window size to the
      number of contenders to avoid packet collisions, the proposed
