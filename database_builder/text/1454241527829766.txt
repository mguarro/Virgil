      Abstract-Currently, several presentation files such as
      SlideShare and MPMeister are shared by many universities
      over the Web. These files are useful and valuable to students.
      However, such files have to be retrieved for self-learning
      purposes, and there is still a lack of support for self-learners
      browsing through slides containing information that might be
      irrelevant to their query. We describe a slide retrieval method
      involving the snippet generation of target slides, and we discuss
      how to present the retrieval results to users by considering
      what portions of the slides are relevant to a user query, on
      the basis of the relationships between slides. This method is
      based on (1) the keyword conceptual structure of the conceptual
      relationship that implicitly exists between keywords that are
      extracted from the slide text of the presentation content by
      WordNet and (2) the presentational structure of the indent
      levels in the slides. With our novel snippet-generation method,
      users can easily determine which slides to learn by browsing
      the relevant portions of the desired slides in the presentation
      and by focusing on portions from either detailed or generalized
      slides. We experimentally confirmed that our method enables
      the users to browse snippets of the retrieved slides efficiently
      and effectively.

      NTRODUCTION
      I. I
      These days, a considerable amount of lecture materials,
      which are often prepared by using teaching materials used in
      actual classes conducted in universities or other education or-
      ganizations, is freely shared on websites such as SlideShare
      1
      2
      and MPMeister . Thus, not only students who missed a
      lecture or presentation but also those interested in the topic
      being discussed in the lecture can review it and study its
      content on their own, according to their convenience.
      A user must formulate a query in the proper manner if
      he or she wishes to retrieve the required lecture slides on
      the basis of matching keywords. If the keywords in a query
      appear repeatedly, many irrelevant slides could be retrieved,
      and this would make it difficult to obtain an appropriate
      retrieval result on the basis of a query. Moreover, one of
      the important functions necessary for archiving presentation
      slides is the ability to retrieve the desired slides using the
      given keywords. For the benefit of users, it is essential that
      certain keywords are supported to enable the retrieval of

      important slides. However, retrieving the important slides
      only on the basis of certain keywords can destroy the implicit
      relevant information between slides and decrease the rele-
      vance of the retrieved slides to the given context, lowering
      the user's understanding of the information on the slides.
      Additionally, these methods do not consider the relevant
      information existing between the slides related to the query;
      it is impossible to easily obtain successful retrieval results
      through the concepts represented by a query.
      We present a novel slide retrieval method to meet users'
      requirements using snippet generation (see Figure 1). This
      retrieval method can be implemented by (1) understanding
      the portions of slides that satisfy a user query and (2)
      generating snippets for the retrieved slides to present the
      relevant portions of slides on the basis of the relationships
      between the slides that include what users need to browse.
      To achieve our goal, we analyzed the implicit semantic
      relationship; in particular, we focused on the conceptual
      relationship between keywords, e.g., an is-a relationship. We
      derived a keyword conceptual structure consisting of the
      conceptual relationship between keywords extracted from
      the slide text. However, the usage of keywords in slides
      varies depending on the author. We derived a presentational
      structure by focusing on certain features of the slides, such as
      the level of indents in the slide text. It was then necessary to
      use the conceptual relationship and presentational structure
      to determine the portions of slides related to the user query;
      furthermore, we detected the relationships between slides in
      terms of the query.
      As an example, consider a user query "vegetable" whose
      snippet in slide is shown in Figure 2. In fact, some
      𝑥
      presentation slides may be related to other slides in terms of
      detailed and generalized information. Therefore, we gener-
      ated snippets of the relevant portions of the retrieved slides
      on the basis of the relationships between slides related to
      the query. For instance, the explanation provided in slide ,
      𝑦
      "cabbage and spinach are leafy vegetables" is more likely to
      be more specific and detailed than the general one provided
      in slide , "vegetables." Therefore, slide has a
      𝑥
      𝑦
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      relation with slide in terms of "vegetable." In this case, a
      𝑥
      of slide
      snippet for slide would look like a portion
      𝑥
      𝑥
      𝑃
      𝑥
      of slide related to "vegetable."
      with a portion

      one shown in Figure 3. It captures the portion of the target
      slide related to the query keyword with the portions of other
      slides that are related to the target slides. We consider that
      the retrieved slide in particular contains information that is
      irrelevant to the query, and we only present a portion of
      the retrieved slide; users might not understand the meaning
      of this portion of the presentation content in terms of the
      query. Therefore, our snippet generation method identifies a
      portion of the retrieved slide along with the relevant portions
      from other slides, on the basis of the relationship between
      the slides in terms of the query.
      Thus, we analyze the relationship between keywords and
      how the keywords in different levels of indents in slides are
      related to a user query. Actually, there are implicit semantic
      relationships between keywords, such as an is-a or a has-
      a relationship. In this study, we consider that users grasp
      the conceptual content easily, and hence, we focus only
      on an is-a relationship between keywords. We define the
      keyword conceptual structure of keywords extracted from
      3
      ,
      the slide text using the conceptual dictionary WordNet
      which is focused on a conceptual relationship, e.g., an is-
      a relationship. Additionally, we define the presentational
      structure of indents in the slide text. As mentioned above,
      we believe that an efficient Slide KWIC should extract
      the portions of the retrieved slides that provide relevant
      information about a user query. On the other hand, we
      generate snippets of the relevant portions of the retrieved
      slides that help users to browse the retrieval results in terms
      of the query from the presentation content.
    
    
      concepts of Slide KWIC as well as reviews of related work.
      Section 3 explains the keyword conceptual structure and
      presentational structure. Thus, we mathematically determine
      the relationships types. Section 4 describes snippet genera-
      tion using the relationships between slides. In Section 5, we
      present an experimental evaluation of our method. Finally,
      Section 6 presents the conclusions of this paper.

      Most of the research related to academic content has been
      focused on the retrieval of slides. Yokota et al. [1] proposed
      a system named Unified Presentation Slide Retrieval by Im-
      pression Search Engine (UPRISE) for retrieving a sequence
      of lecture slides from archives containing a combination of
      slides and recorded videos. Kobayashi et al. [2] proposed

      text. We propose Slide KWIC, which helps users understand
      the target slides related to a user query for generating
      snippets. A snippet for the target slide would look like the

      A. Keyword Conceptual Structure and Presentational Struc-
      ture
      We consider that a semantic relationship implicitly exists
      between keywords extracted from slide text. In particular,
      the conceptual relationship is called an is-a relationship [9],
      [10] and it is used as a basis for the semantic relationship
      between keywords. "X subsumes Y, or Y is-subsumed-by X"
      (Y is-a X) usually means that concept Y is a specialization of
      concept X and that concept X is a generalization of concept
      Y. For example, a "fruit" is a generalization of an "apple,"
      an "orange," a "mango," and many other fruits; in other
      words, an apple is a fruit (apple is-a fruit). Therefore, we
      define a keyword conceptual structure as consisting of an is-
      a relationship between keywords extracted using WordNet.
      We define a presentational structure as a slide that appears
      in the outline pane, on the basis of indents in the slide text
      extracted from the Office Open XML in Microsoft Office
      2007. The slide title (1st level indent) is the upper level.
      The first item of the text is on the 2nd level, and the depth
      of the subitems increases with the level of indentation (3rd
      level, 4th level, and so on). Indents outside the text, such
      as figures or tables, are on the average level of the slide. If
      a given keyword appears in the title of the slide or in lines
      with smaller indents, we implicitly assume that the lower-
      level indented keywords are supplementary and that they
      explain the upper-level keywords.
      Therefore, the conceptual relationship between keywords
      and the level of indents in a slide should both be considered
      for slide retrieval.
    
    
      retrieving lecture slides by UPRISE. Le et al. [3] proposed
      a method for extracting important slides by automatically
      generating digests from recorded presentation videos. Their
      method extracts important slides from unified content on
      the basis of the metadata features of a single medium
      or two heterogeneous media. However, we considered that
      retrieving only the important slides decreases the relevance
      of the results of a user query to the given context, and
      their method cannot be used to browse important slides
      containing information related to a query. This does not
      enhance the user's understanding. Therefore, our objectives
      are to effectively retrieve slides by implicitly accumulating
      the relevant information between slides in terms of a user
      query and to generate snippets of the retrieved slides using
      the relationships between the slides related to the query.
      Kushki et al. [4] proposed a novel XML-based system for
      the retrieval of presentation slides. This system analyzing
      contextual information, such as structural and formatting
      features, is extracted from the open format XML representa-
      tion of slides. Our complementary method considers both the
      structural features of the slides and the semantic information,
      such as the conceptual relationship between keywords in the
      slide text, and it analyzes these two features to determine the
      relationships between slides. Kitayama et al. [5] proposed a
      method for extracting slides on the basis of their semantic
      relationships and roles. Wang et al. [6] presented a method
      for automatically generating learning channels using the
      semantic relationships in slides of a lecture that had an
      accompanying recorded video. These studies are similar to
      ours, in that the researchers have proposed a method for
      the retrieval of slides using the relationships between slides.
      Our method is an extension of these methods by generating
      snippets on the basis of the relationships between slides.
      Parapar et al. [7] proposed a method for snippet generation
      for Blog Search based on sentence selection, using com-
      ments to guide the selection process. We propose a snippet
      generation method for slide retrieval based on the relevant
      portions of slides, and we use the conceptual relationship
      between keywords and the presentational structure of indents
      to detect the relationships between slides. Penin et al.
      [8] extended existing work on ontology summarization to
      support the presentation of ontology snippets for semantic
      web search engines, and the proposed solution leveraged
      a new semantic similarity measure to generate snippets on
      the basis of the given query. This ontological method is
      similar to our method; we focus on the keyword conceptual
      structure as ontology. In addition, Penin et al. [8] computed
      the similarity between bags of words to compare sentences
      and thus generate snippets that displayed query related topics
      and sentences. However, our snippet generation is for slides
      that are not semantic web documents, and we determine the
      relationships between slides using the conceptual relation-
      ships and presentational structure, to provide snippets of the
      portions of slides that are only relevant to the given query.
    
    
      B. Determination of Relationship Types
      We define a focused slide that a slide in question and other
      slides that have specific relationships as being conceptually
      related to the focused slide through one of two types of re-
      lations:
      and

      work [11], we developed a presentation retrieval engine
      based on the relationships between slides and evaluated
      its effectiveness through experiments. This section briefly

      that calculated for slide using Eq. (3), slide is determined
      𝑦
      𝑦
      to be the detailed slide of slide with regard to .
      𝑥
      𝑞
      2) Determination of Generalized Relationships:
      If a slide
      contains content about the query in the outline given in a
      generalized slide, it is described in relation to the focused
      slide. We explain the determination of
      slides
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      using the query keyword that is present in the focused
      𝑞
      slide and slide , which needs to be retrieved.
      𝑥
      𝑦

      𝑠
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      When the query keyword and other keywords in slide
      𝑞
      and slide satisfy Eqs. (1), (2), and (4), then slide
      𝑥
      𝑦
      𝑦
      is determined to be a generalized slide of slide . This is
      𝑥
      because the amount of content in slide that is general with
      𝑦
      respect to is greater than that in slide . Eq. (4) can be
      𝑞
      𝑥
      to
      for
      used to calculate the ratio of
      (𝑥, 𝑞)
      𝐾 (𝑥,𝑞)
      𝐾
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      to
      for slide
      slide and the ratio of
      (𝑦, 𝑞)
      𝐾 (𝑦,𝑞)
      𝑥
      𝐾
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      . When the ratio calculated for slide is lower than that
      𝑦
      𝑥
      calculated for slide using Eq. (4), slide is determined to
      𝑥
      𝑦
      be the generalized slide of slide with regard to .
      𝑥
      𝑞
      As can be seen, detailed and generalized slides are
      functionally interchangeable, whereas a focused slide is a
      generalized slide from the viewpoint of a detailed slide.
    
    
      C. Expansion of Query
      Some slides have relationships with the focused slides
      but do not contain a user query. It is possible to expand
      a user query to detect the relationships between slides in
      terms of the query. In this section, a method for expanding
      a user query using the keyword conceptual structure and the
      presentational structure that is explained. In this method,
      the query keyword is expanded in two ways with the
      𝑞
      aim of determining
      relationships and
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      relationships. Let
      be the number of a focused slide
      𝑥
      and the generalized
      containing the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑠
      of the query keyword (this means that
      is-
      keyword
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ). If the distance between the position of
      a and is-a
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑔
      ( ) and in both the presentational structure and in the
      𝑞 𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑠 𝑔
      keyword conceptual structure is only one, the relevance of
      ( ) and is high, and hence, the meanings of
      ( ) and
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞 𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑠 𝑔
      𝑠 𝑔
      are very nearly identical.
      𝑞
      In the case of
      relationships, if a slide does not
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      contain a user query but has specific, detailed information
      in common with the focused slide in terms of the query, its
      relationship with regard to the focused slide is a
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      one. We explain query expansion to determine the
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      of the query
      relationship using the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑠
      𝑞
      keyword present in the focused slide conforms to certain
      𝑥
    
    
      keyword that is present in the focused slide and slide ,
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑦
      which needs to be retrieved. Figure 4 shows an example of
      the determination of the
      relationship between slide
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      and slide for a query on the word "vegetable."
      𝑥
      𝑦
      When and other keywords in slide and slide satisfy
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑦
      certain conditions, slide is determined to be the detailed
      𝑦
      slide of slide . This is because the amount of content in
      𝑥
      slide that is specific to is greater than that in slide .

      Therefore, our snippet generation method is based on the

      A. Identifying the Portions of Retrieved Slides
      Our method can retrieve slides related to a user query.
      However, whether the information contained on the retrieved
      slides is relevant or irrelevant to the query must be deter-
      mined. Therefore, our method first identifies the portions of
      the retrieved slides related to a user query on the basis of the
      keyword conceptual structure and presentational structure.
      Let
      be the number of the retrieved slide containing

      To generate snippets, Slide KWIC takes the relevant
      portions of the retrieved slides in terms of a user query
      using the relationships between slides. It is difficult for users
      to understand the relevant information between portions of
      slides in terms of the query. For example, a user wants to
      study slide to further understand "vegetable" in the lecture

      of the retrieved slides satisfies user demand by relating

      VALUATION
      V. E
      A. Experiment 1: Validity of Identifying the Portions of
      Slides
      Seven participants freely captured portions of text from
      the indents of slides and assessed 16 sets of slides containing
      four query keywords from three sets of actual academic
      4
      : content
      has 22 slides that explain "Tree
      content
      𝑋
      patterns," content
      has 24 slides that explain "Broadcasting
      𝑌
      Geographic Information," and content
      𝑍has 7 slides that
      explain "News Structure Patterns." A correct answer was
      defined as a portion where four or more test participants
      found the text of indents in the slides that they had captured.
      In this study, we evaluated the validity of the rules for
      identifying the portions of slides in terms of the query
      keywords by precision and recall using the results obtained
      by our method and those obtained from participants who
      gave correct answers. The results of the portions of slides
      related to the given query keywords are listed in Table I.
      We calculate the precision and recall of portions in each
      set of content
      ,
      , and . Additionally, in this experiment,
      𝑋 𝑌 𝑍
      we compared the results containing portions of slides in all
      sets of content extracted by our proposed method and the
      corresponding results obtained by the matching keywords
      method. These experimental results show the recall of all sets
      of experimental academic content was low. In particular, the
      recall of content
      was low, and according to our method,
      𝑍
      many of correct answers did not contain keywords related to
    
    
      in slide such that the texts of the levels ranges from
      𝑙
      𝑥
      𝑚
      the depth of the level containing to the depth of the level
      𝑞
      of , that belongs to
      containing the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑘
      𝑗
      in slide ; the extraction is
      the set of keywords
      (𝑥, 𝑞)
      𝑥

      performed using Eq. (2). In Eq. (8),
      is the depth of
      𝑙(𝑞)
      the level containing in slide and its depth is not greater
      𝑞
      𝑥
      of the text from the given level;
      than the depth

      )
      𝑥
      𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑙
      𝑚
      the text from the given level. Thus, Eq. (9) can be used to
      extract the portion of slide and thus combines the sets
      𝑃

      B. Determining the Relevant Portions of Related Slides
      Our method generates snippets on the basis of the re-
      lationships between slides related to a user query. The
      relevant portions are then extracted from slides that have
      relationships with the retrieved slides in terms of the query.
      1) Determining the Portions of Generalized Slides:
      When
      slide
      is a generalized slide that has a generalized relation-
      𝑥
      𝑔
      ship with the retrieved slide related to the query keyword
      𝑥
      of slide provides the general content of
      , the portion
      𝑥
      𝑞
      𝑃
      𝑔
      𝑔
      the portion of the retrieved slide related to . Therefore,
      𝑃
      𝑥
      𝑞
      of the generalized slide
      is determined
      the portion
      𝑥
      𝑃
      𝑔
      𝑔
      using the query keyword and the generalized keyword
      𝑞
      𝑘
      𝑖
      is determined from the retrieved slide .
      𝑥

      When and other keywords in slide
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑔
      of the generalized slide
      (7), and (10), then the portion
      𝑃
      𝑔
      is determined. This is because slide
      contains more
      𝑥
      𝑥
      𝑔
      𝑔
      general content related to than does slide . For slide

      the query keywords. We believe that one of the reasons for
      obtaining these results is that our method uses only an is-a
      relationship between keywords, and not a has-a relationship.
      For instance, while the keywords, "subject" and "status" are
      likely to be part of the query keyword "structure," since they
      would be used in more detailed explanations of "structure,"
      our method based on WordNet cannot extract the has-a
      relationship between them. However, the recall of content
      was very high, and the number of results containing
      𝑌
      portions extracted by our method was greater than correct
      answers. We believe that the participants did not consider
      the title of the slides in terms of the query keywords when
      our method was used. This reduced the precision of our
      method. Although the results of the comparison of the two
      methods look similar, the methods did not extract portions
      of slides that explained the query keywords, even though
      they did not contain them; this is because our method does
      not extract portions of slides only on the basis of the query
      keywords. From the results of this experiment, we confirmed
      that our method can extract the appropriate portions of slides
      using the conceptual relationship between keywords and
      the presentational structure of indents. However, we would
      like to use an enhanced method for extracting not only
      the is-a relationship between keywords but also the has-a
      relationship between keywords.

      4
      determine that "subject" or "status" has a part-of relationship
      with "structure"; this was one of the reasons why the recall
      was low. However, the precision of almost all snippets in
      the present experiments was high. These results indicate
      that our method generates snippets of the relevant portions
    
    
      B. Experiment 2: Validity of Generating Snippets
      We showed the participants the following four data sets
      that are composed of four query keywords in the slides
      retrieved from the three sets of actual academic content used
      in Experiment 1. We then presented four snippets of the
      relevant portions and the portions of four slides pertaining to
      the four query keywords; the snippets presented a detailed
      explanation of the keywords in the order of the relevant
      portions in the slides. Five participants took part in this
      experiment. A correct answer was defined as snippets of the
      portions of slides where three or more test participants found
      the snippets that they presented in their free descriptions.
      As shown by the results in Table II, note that the recall
      of almost all experimental snippets was low here, e.g., the
      recall of snippet
      for slide with the query keyword
      𝐷

      "structure" (see Figure 6). When our method was used in
      , and

      experiment 1, it was determined that many of the correct

      of slides on the basis of the relationships between slides
      and that the method can be successfully applied to slide
      retrieval based on the use of snippets containing the portions
      that contain detailed explanations of the content related to
      the query. However, the precision of snippet
      𝐶was low
      since it does not explain the content related to the query in
      detail. Figure 7 shows snippet
      for slide for the query
      𝐶

      keyword "group"; our method determined that slide has
      10

      10
      group" did not explain "group" in detail in the portion
      𝑃
      9
      by participants' descriptions. We believe that one reason for
      obtaining this result is that the participants did not recognize
      the relationships between slides from which certain relevant
      portions were present in the snippets. In addition, many of
      the relevant portions were not strongly related to the portion
      of the retrieved slide, and this reduced the precision. It
      can be seen that our method can generate snippets of the
      relevant portions of slides related via the query by effectively
      using the relationships between slides. The results of this
      experiment suggest that we need to improve the snippet-
      generating algorithm using the relationships between slides
      and extracting the relevant portions of slides.

      We have proposed Slide KWIC using conceptual relation-
      ships and presentational structure. Our snippet-generation
      method is used to retrieve desired slides and generate
      snippets of retrieved slides on the basis of the relationships
      between slides with regard to a user query. The type of
      relationship is based on the conceptual relationships between
      keywords and the presentational structure of indents in the
      slide text. In several experiments, our method was able to
      extract relevant portions by using conceptual relationships
      and presentational structure, and the portions cannot be
      extracted using the matching keywords method. Moreover,
      we evaluated the validity of generating snippets; however,
      we must be able to evaluate the efficacy of browsing snippets
      when users browse slides with their snippets.
      In the future, we plan to finish developing a prototype
      system and evaluate it with a large set of actual lecture
      data. Our method can enhance retrieval techniques if a user
      proposes a query that includes two or more keywords; the
      relationship between the keywords in the query needs to be
      determined to retrieve the user's desired slides by analyzing
      the relevance of the queried keywords. We can also extend
      this approach to use not only an is-a relationship but also
      a has-a relationship between keywords; further, we can also
      use the presentational structure to determine the relationships

      Abstract-Currently, several presentation files such as
      SlideShare and MPMeister are shared by many universities
      over the Web. These files are useful and valuable to students.
      However, such files have to be retrieved for self-learning
      purposes, and there is still a lack of support for self-learners
      browsing through slides containing information that might be
      irrelevant to their query. We describe a slide retrieval method
      involving the snippet generation of target slides, and we discuss
      how to present the retrieval results to users by considering
      what portions of the slides are relevant to a user query, on
      the basis of the relationships between slides. This method is
      based on (1) the keyword conceptual structure of the conceptual
      relationship that implicitly exists between keywords that are
      extracted from the slide text of the presentation content by
      WordNet and (2) the presentational structure of the indent
      levels in the slides. With our novel snippet-generation method,
      users can easily determine which slides to learn by browsing
      the relevant portions of the desired slides in the presentation
      and by focusing on portions from either detailed or generalized
      slides. We experimentally confirmed that our method enables
      the users to browse snippets of the retrieved slides efficiently
      and effectively.

      NTRODUCTION
      I. I
      These days, a considerable amount of lecture materials,
      which are often prepared by using teaching materials used in
      actual classes conducted in universities or other education or-
      ganizations, is freely shared on websites such as SlideShare
      1
      2
      and MPMeister . Thus, not only students who missed a
      lecture or presentation but also those interested in the topic
      being discussed in the lecture can review it and study its
      content on their own, according to their convenience.
      A user must formulate a query in the proper manner if
      he or she wishes to retrieve the required lecture slides on
      the basis of matching keywords. If the keywords in a query
      appear repeatedly, many irrelevant slides could be retrieved,
      and this would make it difficult to obtain an appropriate
      retrieval result on the basis of a query. Moreover, one of
      the important functions necessary for archiving presentation
      slides is the ability to retrieve the desired slides using the
      given keywords. For the benefit of users, it is essential that
      certain keywords are supported to enable the retrieval of

      important slides. However, retrieving the important slides
      only on the basis of certain keywords can destroy the implicit
      relevant information between slides and decrease the rele-
      vance of the retrieved slides to the given context, lowering
      the user's understanding of the information on the slides.
      Additionally, these methods do not consider the relevant
      information existing between the slides related to the query;
      it is impossible to easily obtain successful retrieval results
      through the concepts represented by a query.
      We present a novel slide retrieval method to meet users'
      requirements using snippet generation (see Figure 1). This
      retrieval method can be implemented by (1) understanding
      the portions of slides that satisfy a user query and (2)
      generating snippets for the retrieved slides to present the
      relevant portions of slides on the basis of the relationships
      between the slides that include what users need to browse.
      To achieve our goal, we analyzed the implicit semantic
      relationship; in particular, we focused on the conceptual
      relationship between keywords, e.g., an is-a relationship. We
      derived a keyword conceptual structure consisting of the
      conceptual relationship between keywords extracted from
      the slide text. However, the usage of keywords in slides
      varies depending on the author. We derived a presentational
      structure by focusing on certain features of the slides, such as
      the level of indents in the slide text. It was then necessary to
      use the conceptual relationship and presentational structure
      to determine the portions of slides related to the user query;
      furthermore, we detected the relationships between slides in
      terms of the query.
      As an example, consider a user query "vegetable" whose
      snippet in slide is shown in Figure 2. In fact, some
      𝑥
      presentation slides may be related to other slides in terms of
      detailed and generalized information. Therefore, we gener-
      ated snippets of the relevant portions of the retrieved slides
      on the basis of the relationships between slides related to
      the query. For instance, the explanation provided in slide ,
      𝑦
      "cabbage and spinach are leafy vegetables" is more likely to
      be more specific and detailed than the general one provided
      in slide , "vegetables." Therefore, slide has a
      𝑥
      𝑦
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      relation with slide in terms of "vegetable." In this case, a
      𝑥
      of slide
      snippet for slide would look like a portion
      𝑥
      𝑥
      𝑃
      𝑥
      of slide related to "vegetable."
      with a portion

      one shown in Figure 3. It captures the portion of the target
      slide related to the query keyword with the portions of other
      slides that are related to the target slides. We consider that
      the retrieved slide in particular contains information that is
      irrelevant to the query, and we only present a portion of
      the retrieved slide; users might not understand the meaning
      of this portion of the presentation content in terms of the
      query. Therefore, our snippet generation method identifies a
      portion of the retrieved slide along with the relevant portions
      from other slides, on the basis of the relationship between
      the slides in terms of the query.
      Thus, we analyze the relationship between keywords and
      how the keywords in different levels of indents in slides are
      related to a user query. Actually, there are implicit semantic
      relationships between keywords, such as an is-a or a has-
      a relationship. In this study, we consider that users grasp
      the conceptual content easily, and hence, we focus only
      on an is-a relationship between keywords. We define the
      keyword conceptual structure of keywords extracted from
      3
      ,
      the slide text using the conceptual dictionary WordNet
      which is focused on a conceptual relationship, e.g., an is-
      a relationship. Additionally, we define the presentational
      structure of indents in the slide text. As mentioned above,
      we believe that an efficient Slide KWIC should extract
      the portions of the retrieved slides that provide relevant
      information about a user query. On the other hand, we
      generate snippets of the relevant portions of the retrieved
      slides that help users to browse the retrieval results in terms
      of the query from the presentation content.
    
    
      concepts of Slide KWIC as well as reviews of related work.
      Section 3 explains the keyword conceptual structure and
      presentational structure. Thus, we mathematically determine
      the relationships types. Section 4 describes snippet genera-
      tion using the relationships between slides. In Section 5, we
      present an experimental evaluation of our method. Finally,
      Section 6 presents the conclusions of this paper.

      of lecture slides from archives containing a combination of

      the target slides related to a user query for generating
      snippets. A snippet for the target slide would look like the

      A. Keyword Conceptual Structure and Presentational Struc-
      ture
      We consider that a semantic relationship implicitly exists
      between keywords extracted from slide text. In particular,
      the conceptual relationship is called an is-a relationship [9],
      [10] and it is used as a basis for the semantic relationship
      between keywords. "X subsumes Y, or Y is-subsumed-by X"
      (Y is-a X) usually means that concept Y is a specialization of
      concept X and that concept X is a generalization of concept
      Y. For example, a "fruit" is a generalization of an "apple,"
      an "orange," a "mango," and many other fruits; in other
      words, an apple is a fruit (apple is-a fruit). Therefore, we
      define a keyword conceptual structure as consisting of an is-
      a relationship between keywords extracted using WordNet.
      We define a presentational structure as a slide that appears
      in the outline pane, on the basis of indents in the slide text
      extracted from the Office Open XML in Microsoft Office
      2007. The slide title (1st level indent) is the upper level.
      The first item of the text is on the 2nd level, and the depth
      of the subitems increases with the level of indentation (3rd
      level, 4th level, and so on). Indents outside the text, such
      as figures or tables, are on the average level of the slide. If
      a given keyword appears in the title of the slide or in lines
      with smaller indents, we implicitly assume that the lower-
      level indented keywords are supplementary and that they
      explain the upper-level keywords.
      Therefore, the conceptual relationship between keywords
      and the level of indents in a slide should both be considered
      for slide retrieval.
    
    
      retrieving lecture slides by UPRISE. Le et al. [3] proposed
      a method for extracting important slides by automatically
      generating digests from recorded presentation videos. Their
      method extracts important slides from unified content on
      the basis of the metadata features of a single medium
      or two heterogeneous media. However, we considered that
      retrieving only the important slides decreases the relevance
      of the results of a user query to the given context, and
      their method cannot be used to browse important slides
      containing information related to a query. This does not
      enhance the user's understanding. Therefore, our objectives
      are to effectively retrieve slides by implicitly accumulating
      the relevant information between slides in terms of a user
      query and to generate snippets of the retrieved slides using
      the relationships between the slides related to the query.
      Kushki et al. [4] proposed a novel XML-based system for
      the retrieval of presentation slides. This system analyzing
      contextual information, such as structural and formatting
      features, is extracted from the open format XML representa-
      tion of slides. Our complementary method considers both the
      structural features of the slides and the semantic information,
      such as the conceptual relationship between keywords in the
      slide text, and it analyzes these two features to determine the
      relationships between slides. Kitayama et al. [5] proposed a
      method for extracting slides on the basis of their semantic
      relationships and roles. Wang et al. [6] presented a method
      for automatically generating learning channels using the
      semantic relationships in slides of a lecture that had an
      accompanying recorded video. These studies are similar to
      ours, in that the researchers have proposed a method for
      the retrieval of slides using the relationships between slides.
      Our method is an extension of these methods by generating
      snippets on the basis of the relationships between slides.
      Parapar et al. [7] proposed a method for snippet generation
      for Blog Search based on sentence selection, using com-
      ments to guide the selection process. We propose a snippet
      generation method for slide retrieval based on the relevant
      portions of slides, and we use the conceptual relationship
      between keywords and the presentational structure of indents
      to detect the relationships between slides. Penin et al.
      [8] extended existing work on ontology summarization to
      support the presentation of ontology snippets for semantic
      web search engines, and the proposed solution leveraged
      a new semantic similarity measure to generate snippets on
      the basis of the given query. This ontological method is
      similar to our method; we focus on the keyword conceptual
      structure as ontology. In addition, Penin et al. [8] computed
      the similarity between bags of words to compare sentences
      and thus generate snippets that displayed query related topics
      and sentences. However, our snippet generation is for slides
      that are not semantic web documents, and we determine the
      relationships between slides using the conceptual relation-
      ships and presentational structure, to provide snippets of the
      portions of slides that are only relevant to the given query.
    
    
      B. Determination of Relationship Types
      We define a focused slide that a slide in question and other
      slides that have specific relationships as being conceptually
      related to the focused slide through one of two types of re-
      lations:
      and
      . If a slide has a
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      relationship with the other slides, it is called a
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      slide. If a slide has a
      relationship with the
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      other slides, it is called a
      slide. In our previous
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      work [11], we developed a presentation retrieval engine
      based on the relationships between slides and evaluated
      its effectiveness through experiments. This section briefly
      explains the manner in which the types of relationships are
      determined. Let
      be the number of a focused slide and
      𝑥
      𝑦
      be the number of the slide that we want to retrieve. Slide
      𝑥
      and . The types of relationships are
      contains keywords
      𝑘
      𝑘

      determined for all slides for keyword in a user query.

      1) Determination of Detailed Relationships:
      If a slide has
      more information about a user query than the focused slide,
      one. We
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      explain the determination of
      slides using the query
      its relationship with the focused slide is a

      𝑦
      to be the detailed slide of slide with regard to .
      𝑥
      𝑞
      2) Determination of Generalized Relationships:
      If a slide
      contains content about the query in the outline given in a
      generalized slide, it is described in relation to the focused
      slide. We explain the determination of
      slides
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      using the query keyword that is present in the focused
      𝑞
      slide and slide , which needs to be retrieved.
      𝑥
      𝑦

      𝑠
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      When the query keyword and other keywords in slide
      𝑞
      and slide satisfy Eqs. (1), (2), and (4), then slide
      𝑥
      𝑦
      𝑦
      is determined to be a generalized slide of slide . This is
      𝑥
      because the amount of content in slide that is general with
      𝑦
      respect to is greater than that in slide . Eq. (4) can be
      𝑞
      𝑥
      to
      for
      used to calculate the ratio of
      (𝑥, 𝑞)
      𝐾 (𝑥,𝑞)
      𝐾
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      to
      for slide
      slide and the ratio of
      (𝑦, 𝑞)
      𝐾 (𝑦,𝑞)
      𝑥
      𝐾
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      ∣
      . When the ratio calculated for slide is lower than that
      𝑦
      𝑥
      calculated for slide using Eq. (4), slide is determined to
      𝑥
      𝑦
      be the generalized slide of slide with regard to .
      𝑥
      𝑞
      As can be seen, detailed and generalized slides are
      functionally interchangeable, whereas a focused slide is a
      generalized slide from the viewpoint of a detailed slide.
    
    
      C. Expansion of Query
      Some slides have relationships with the focused slides
      but do not contain a user query. It is possible to expand
      a user query to detect the relationships between slides in
      terms of the query. In this section, a method for expanding
      a user query using the keyword conceptual structure and the
      presentational structure that is explained. In this method,
      the query keyword is expanded in two ways with the
      𝑞
      aim of determining
      relationships and
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑
      relationships. Let
      be the number of a focused slide
      𝑥
      and the generalized
      containing the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑠
      of the query keyword (this means that
      is-
      keyword
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑔
      𝑠
      ). If the distance between the position of
      a and is-a
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑔
      ( ) and in both the presentational structure and in the
      𝑞 𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑠 𝑔
      keyword conceptual structure is only one, the relevance of
      ( ) and is high, and hence, the meanings of
      ( ) and
      𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑞 𝑞
      𝑞
      𝑠 𝑔
      𝑠 𝑔
      are very nearly identical.
      𝑞
      In the case of
      relationships, if a slide does not
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      contain a user query but has specific, detailed information
      in common with the focused slide in terms of the query, its
      relationship with regard to the focused slide is a
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      one. We explain query expansion to determine the
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      of the query
      relationship using the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑠
      𝑞
      keyword present in the focused slide conforms to certain
      𝑥
    
    
      keyword that is present in the focused slide and slide ,
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑦
      which needs to be retrieved. Figure 4 shows an example of
      the determination of the
      relationship between slide
      𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑
      and slide for a query on the word "vegetable."
      𝑥
      𝑦
      When and other keywords in slide and slide satisfy
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑦
      certain conditions, slide is determined to be the detailed
      𝑦
      slide of slide . This is because the amount of content in
      𝑥
      slide that is specific to is greater than that in slide .

      Therefore, our snippet generation method is based on the

      A. Identifying the Portions of Retrieved Slides
      Our method can retrieve slides related to a user query.
      However, whether the information contained on the retrieved
      slides is relevant or irrelevant to the query must be deter-
      mined. Therefore, our method first identifies the portions of
      the retrieved slides related to a user query on the basis of the
      keyword conceptual structure and presentational structure.
      Let
      be the number of the retrieved slide containing
      𝑥

      To generate snippets, Slide KWIC takes the relevant
      portions of the retrieved slides in terms of a user query
      using the relationships between slides. It is difficult for users
      to understand the relevant information between portions of
      slides in terms of the query. For example, a user wants to
      study slide to further understand "vegetable" in the lecture

      of the retrieved slides satisfies user demand by relating

      VALUATION
      V. E
      A. Experiment 1: Validity of Identifying the Portions of
      Slides
      Seven participants freely captured portions of text from
      the indents of slides and assessed 16 sets of slides containing
      four query keywords from three sets of actual academic
      4
      : content
      has 22 slides that explain "Tree
      content
      𝑋
      patterns," content
      has 24 slides that explain "Broadcasting
      𝑌
      Geographic Information," and content
      𝑍has 7 slides that
      explain "News Structure Patterns." A correct answer was
      defined as a portion where four or more test participants
      found the text of indents in the slides that they had captured.
      In this study, we evaluated the validity of the rules for
      identifying the portions of slides in terms of the query
      keywords by precision and recall using the results obtained
      by our method and those obtained from participants who
      gave correct answers. The results of the portions of slides
      related to the given query keywords are listed in Table I.
      We calculate the precision and recall of portions in each
      set of content
      ,
      , and . Additionally, in this experiment,
      𝑋 𝑌 𝑍
      we compared the results containing portions of slides in all
      sets of content extracted by our proposed method and the
      corresponding results obtained by the matching keywords
      method. These experimental results show the recall of all sets
      of experimental academic content was low. In particular, the
      recall of content
      was low, and according to our method,
      𝑍
      many of correct answers did not contain keywords related to
    
    
      in slide such that the texts of the levels ranges from
      𝑙
      𝑥
      𝑚
      the depth of the level containing to the depth of the level
      𝑞
      of , that belongs to
      containing the specified keyword
      𝑞
      𝑘
      𝑗
      in slide ; the extraction is
      the set of keywords
      (𝑥, 𝑞)
      𝑥
      𝐾

      performed using Eq. (2). In Eq. (8),
      is the depth of
      𝑙(𝑞)
      the level containing in slide and its depth is not greater
      𝑞
      𝑥
      of the text from the given level;
      than the depth

      𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑙

      𝑘

      slide and its depth
      )
      𝑥
      𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑙
      𝑚
      the text from the given level. Thus, Eq. (9) can be used to
      extract the portion of slide and thus combines the sets
      𝑃
      𝑥
      and
      .

      B. Determining the Relevant Portions of Related Slides
      Our method generates snippets on the basis of the re-
      lationships between slides related to a user query. The
      relevant portions are then extracted from slides that have
      relationships with the retrieved slides in terms of the query.
      1) Determining the Portions of Generalized Slides:
      When
      slide
      is a generalized slide that has a generalized relation-
      𝑥
      𝑔
      ship with the retrieved slide related to the query keyword
      𝑥
      of slide provides the general content of
      , the portion
      𝑥
      𝑞
      𝑃
      𝑔
      𝑔
      the portion of the retrieved slide related to . Therefore,
      𝑃
      𝑥
      𝑞
      of the generalized slide
      is determined
      the portion
      𝑥
      𝑃
      𝑔
      𝑔
      using the query keyword and the generalized keyword
      𝑞
      𝑘
      𝑖
      is determined from the retrieved slide .
      𝑥

      When and other keywords in slide
      𝑞
      𝑥
      𝑔
      of the generalized slide
      (7), and (10), then the portion
      𝑃
      𝑔
      is determined. This is because slide
      contains more
      𝑥
      𝑥
      𝑔
      𝑔
      general content related to than does slide . For slide

      P
    
    
      the query keywords. We believe that one of the reasons for
      obtaining these results is that our method uses only an is-a
      relationship between keywords, and not a has-a relationship.
      For instance, while the keywords, "subject" and "status" are
      likely to be part of the query keyword "structure," since they
      would be used in more detailed explanations of "structure,"
      our method based on WordNet cannot extract the has-a
      relationship between them. However, the recall of content
      was very high, and the number of results containing
      𝑌
      portions extracted by our method was greater than correct
      answers. We believe that the participants did not consider
      the title of the slides in terms of the query keywords when
      our method was used. This reduced the precision of our
      method. Although the results of the comparison of the two
      methods look similar, the methods did not extract portions
      of slides that explained the query keywords, even though
      they did not contain them; this is because our method does
      not extract portions of slides only on the basis of the query
      keywords. From the results of this experiment, we confirmed
      that our method can extract the appropriate portions of slides
      using the conceptual relationship between keywords and
      the presentational structure of indents. However, we would
      like to use an enhanced method for extracting not only
      the is-a relationship between keywords but also the has-a
      relationship between keywords.

      4
      determine that "subject" or "status" has a part-of relationship
      with "structure"; this was one of the reasons why the recall
      was low. However, the precision of almost all snippets in
      the present experiments was high. These results indicate
      that our method generates snippets of the relevant portions
    
    
      B. Experiment 2: Validity of Generating Snippets
      We showed the participants the following four data sets
      that are composed of four query keywords in the slides
      retrieved from the three sets of actual academic content used
      in Experiment 1. We then presented four snippets of the
      relevant portions and the portions of four slides pertaining to
      the four query keywords; the snippets presented a detailed
      explanation of the keywords in the order of the relevant
      portions in the slides. Five participants took part in this
      experiment. A correct answer was defined as snippets of the
      portions of slides where three or more test participants found
      the snippets that they presented in their free descriptions.
      As shown by the results in Table II, note that the recall
      of almost all experimental snippets was low here, e.g., the
      recall of snippet
      for slide with the query keyword
      𝐷
      3
      "structure" (see Figure 6). When our method was used in
      , and
      answers did not contain the text at indents

      experiment 1, it was determined that many of the correct

      of slides on the basis of the relationships between slides
      and that the method can be successfully applied to slide
      retrieval based on the use of snippets containing the portions
      that contain detailed explanations of the content related to
      the query. However, the precision of snippet
      𝐶was low
      since it does not explain the content related to the query in
      detail. Figure 7 shows snippet
      for slide for the query
      𝐶
      9
      keyword "group"; our method determined that slide has
      10
      a detailed relationship with slide in terms of "group,"
      9
      about " direction of motion of the
      but the portion

      10
      group" did not explain "group" in detail in the portion
      𝑃
      9
      by participants' descriptions. We believe that one reason for
      obtaining this result is that the participants did not recognize
      the relationships between slides from which certain relevant
      portions were present in the snippets. In addition, many of
      the relevant portions were not strongly related to the portion
      of the retrieved slide, and this reduced the precision. It
      can be seen that our method can generate snippets of the
      relevant portions of slides related via the query by effectively
      using the relationships between slides. The results of this
      experiment suggest that we need to improve the snippet-
      generating algorithm using the relationships between slides
      and extracting the relevant portions of slides.

      We have proposed Slide KWIC using conceptual relation-
      ships and presentational structure. Our snippet-generation
      method is used to retrieve desired slides and generate
      snippets of retrieved slides on the basis of the relationships
      between slides with regard to a user query. The type of
      relationship is based on the conceptual relationships between
      keywords and the presentational structure of indents in the
      slide text. In several experiments, our method was able to
      extract relevant portions by using conceptual relationships
      and presentational structure, and the portions cannot be
      extracted using the matching keywords method. Moreover,
      we evaluated the validity of generating snippets; however,
      we must be able to evaluate the efficacy of browsing snippets
      when users browse slides with their snippets.
      In the future, we plan to finish developing a prototype
      system and evaluate it with a large set of actual lecture
      data. Our method can enhance retrieval techniques if a user
      proposes a query that includes two or more keywords; the
      relationship between the keywords in the query needs to be
      determined to retrieve the user's desired slides by analyzing
      the relevance of the queried keywords. We can also extend
      this approach to use not only an is-a relationship but also
      a has-a relationship between keywords; further, we can also
      use the presentational structure to determine the relationships
      between slides.
